# Welcome to the Smart Contract Audit Reports Repository
This is the official GitHub repository for the Smart Contract Audit Reports of Blockhat. This repository serves as a hub for the transparency of our organization's smart contract audits, validating the security of our smart contracts for both current and potential clients.
## Contents
This repository contains the audit reports for each of our smart contracts. Each smart contract has its own folder, which contains the following:

* The audited smart contract code
* A detailed audit report
* Any potential issues found, along with the severity of each issue
* Recommendations for addressing these issues

## How to Read an Audit Report

Each audit report is divided into the following sections:

* Overview: A brief description of the smart contract's purpose.
* Scope of the Audit: The specific aspects of the contract that were audited.
* Key Observations: Important notes about the smart contract, if any.
* Issues: Any potential issues or vulnerabilities discovered during the audit, along with the severity of each issue.
* Recommendations: Suggested solutions for each issue.
* Tests: Results of tests provided by clients. These tests are used to validate the contract's functionality under specified conditions.
* Automated Vulnerability Scans (Slither): These are the results of automated scans for common vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the contract's code.

Issues are categorized by severity:

* Critical: These issues pose immediate risks to the contract's security or functionality.
* High: These issues are serious but don't pose immediate risks.
* Medium: These issues highlight areas where the contract's code could be improved or optimized.
* Low: These issues are minor concerns, often relating to readability or convention.
* Best Practice: These are not issues, but recommendations that can improve the contract's quality, efficiency, or readability.
